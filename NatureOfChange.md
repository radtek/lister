# Introduction #

What areas of this project are generally active?  Every project owner/developer works in their own way, and they commonly expect people to just "figure it out".  Unfortunately, people browsing the project contents have no idea if what they are looking at is the result of much labor and care, or just casually whipped up to fulfill a requirement.
Below I have listed what areas of the project I work in most and what I try to keep up the most frequently.

# Details #
  * First and foremost, I update the code.  It is the most critical, and I guess this follows the Agile mode of programming, somewhat.
  * Comments within the code are the first place I document.  A few lines are added to each function and each class, but notes around single lines of code are often over-explained.  I find that the key misunderstandings reside at very specific points in code, and I try to account for that.  Plus if that line changes, I'm more likely to update the comment that is right above it.
  * I don't yet have header comments on each cpp file, and I probably should.
  * SVN Commit.  I usually comment a series of dashed lines per each cpp/h file pair.  If a comment is relevant and I happen to remember, I'll reused that comment at the other file's checkin, but that is rare.
  * Frequent commits.  I try to commit daily, which means more relevant and traceable changes, but also more buggy code is released.
  * Refactoring.  I often refactor just at the sight of unsightly code.  I refactor cpp files when I see they are getting too big, but only a few functions at a time.  I test as I go.
  * I used to use tools to unittest, but I don't currently have anything set up.
  * I may start to use the T++ facility in U++, but the comments would then only be available from within the U++ IDE.  They are nice, though, since they popup on hover, include richtext, and don't eat up code space.
  * The main project page: Functionality So Far I constantly add to as I add functions since I'll forget what I added as I move downstream.
  * Wiki Log page. I try to add high-level notes here dated to the month level.
  * Hopefully will get back into blogging about this project as I did a previous project (jammit).
  * I would add a Google Group, but I can't access it while working so its not much use to me.
  * I know there needs to be sample code, database samples, script samples, and a tutorial with screen shots.  Someday.
  * An installation guide is needed.
  * The Issues tab is not as frequently attended to.  The relative importance of issues changes second to second based on my work requirements, so many issues become left for much later.
