1	Avoid modal dialogs	Dialogs prevent cut and paste from various parts of the app.  In actimize this prevents an expression browser test from cut and pasting from a function.
2	Resize anything	"For some reason, many products, like DTS, don't bother to allow resizing on their dialogs, making use very difficult for large scripts."
3	Remember last size of each window	
4	"Locking dialogs, but R/O other objects"	"Interesting idea: a pop-up dialog would be pinned, and you could R/O anything else, but can't start any processes that could change. Hmmm."
5	Pinnable windows	Can pin/unpin any window
6	Right-click any label/field pair and see the argument that controls it	Might work; then you could pass in that argument on a run to control the value.
7	Full screen anything	"except with an easy key like F12, instead of MS's version Shift-Ctl Enter."
8	Shift-Enter is new line inside a dialog	
9	Drag and drop always does something	
10	Shift-F2 expands any text of drop down field or zooms any QTextEdit box	
11	Macros work anywhere	
12	Cut and paste any GUI message to clipboard	Should always be an option on any dialog.
13	View log from any point with search	Had this in an Access tool.  Could popup a view of the log file that was generating for the current run and went to the tail end.  Should default to -100 tail.
14	Multi-key search in any list	"When you are in a combo list, set, grid, tree, the current column is searched according to multiple quickly typed letters.  Forgets after definable time."
15	Sort any column; multi-sort off any number of columns	
16	"Filter any grid, list, text file"	
17	"Reorder columns in any set, grid, list"	
18	Paste formatted/unformatted	
19	Google it on context menu	
20	"Copy any text from any screen/widget/label, including about box, etc."	Adobe hoses up when you try to cut and paste a single line or word.  Makes life hard
