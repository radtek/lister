               Import library to Include file conversion.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are now two separate versions of the earlier utility l2inc.exe, one
for the ANSI functions and the other for UNICODE functions. 

  Files.

  l2inca.exe Version 1.2A 16896 bytes The ANSI version
  l2incu.exe Version 1.2U 16986 bytes The UNICODE version

Both versions are identical except for the way they filter the function
names. A couple of refinements have been done to make the utilities more
flexible. They still support both TASM & MASM syntax, libraries that do not
have imports will not generate and empty include file and the internal
filtering is now more robust. 

While these utilities were designed for the PLATFORMSDK libraries, they
have been tested on the VC98 Microsoft libraries as well and the current
filtering appears to handle static libraries without the previous problems.

Both utilities are copyright freeware, the copyright is displayed when the
programs are run without parameters. Any programmer is welcome to use these
